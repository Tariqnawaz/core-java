Strings (refer stringConsolidatedPoints.java for all the below points).

String Literals :
1. String literals are treated as objects of java.lang.String class. You can also create the objects of String class without using new 
   operator.
2. 

String Concetination
1. Addition of the objects takes place from left to right.   
2. You can concatenate a string object with other data types like int, double, long, char etc.
3. we can concatenate string objects without using “+” operator. This can be done using concat() method of java.lang.String class.
4. 

charAt() Method :
1. This method returns character at the specified index.

getChars() Method
1. This method copies the set of characters from the string into specified character array.

toCharArray() Method :
1. This method converts whole string into a character array.

subString() Method
1. This method returns a sub string of the specified string.

How The Strings Are Stored In The Memory? 
1. We all know that JVM divides the allocated memory to a Java program into two parts. one is Stack and another one is heap. 
2. Stack is used for execution purpose and heap is used for storage purpose. In that heap memory, JVM allocates some memory specially 
   meant for string literals. This part of the heap memory is called String Constant Pool.

For example, when you create string objects like below, they will be stored in the String Constant Pool.
String s1 = "abc"; 
String s2 = "xyz";
String s3 = "123";
String s4 = "A";

And when you create string objects using new keyword like below, they will be stored in the heap memory.
String s5 = new String("abc");
char[] c = {'J', 'A', 'V', 'A'};
String s6 = new String(c);
String s7 = new String(new StringBuffer());
This is how String Constant Pool looks like in the memory. For more information see String-constant-pool image.

StringBuffer And StringBuilder
1. Both are use to modify the string . StringBuffer is synchornised and stringBuilder is not-synchronised.
2. 

String Intern In Java
1. String objects in java are stored in two places in memory. One is String Constant Pool and another one is Heap Memory. String objects 
   created using string literals are stored in String Constant Pool where as string objects created using new operator are stored in heap
   memory.
